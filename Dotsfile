# Dotsfile 
#
# This file is imported by Dots (github.com/totegoat/dots) as a 
# configuration file of sorts, though it is technically a BASH library.
#
# Place this file in the root of your dotfiles Git repository for the Dots
# tool to be able to know how to handle your dotfiles.
#
# Dots has essentially two overarching management actions: pull and push. 
# This is the order that this configuration file is processed by Dots:
#
#    PULL                              PUSH

#    1. Directories (create)           Archives (zip)
#    2. Dotfiles (link)                Secrets (encrypt)

# DIRECTORIES 
#
# These are required directories that must exist before dotfiles, secrets, and
# archives are placed into them.
#
# Directories will NOT be tracked by Git. 
#
# For example, if your .vimrc is configured to use .vim/tmp for your backup 
# files, you just want it created to support your .vimrc, but not tracking
# all those files in Git.
#
# If you want a directory and its contents to be tracked, put them in DOTFILES. 
#
# Format: "<directory path> <octal permissions>"
#
dotdirs=(
    # Dots will create both .vim and tmp, but if you want a different perm
    # set for the .vim parent dir, then specify it before (".vim 740"), as 
    # elements of this array are processed in order.
    ".vim/tmp 755"

    # don't want this tracked, but need it for encrypted SSH config
    ".ssh 700"       

    # encrypted archive of server keys will unzip here
    ".ssh/keys 700"  
)

# DOTFILES
#
# If you want a directory and its contents tracked, map the directory name
# rather than each file within the directory. However, if you only want a
# selection of the files within the directory to be tracked, you can explicitly
# list them out. 
#
# Format: "<repo source> <local destination>"
#
dotfiles=(
    "bashrc .bashrc"
    "gitconfig .gitconfig"
    "vimrc .vimrc"
    "vim/colors .vim/colors"  # this will track the directory and files within
                              # .vim will already be created from dotdirs above
)

# SECRETS
#
#
# Format: "<repo source> <local destination> <octal permissions>"
#
secrets=(
    "
)

# ARCHIVES
#
# Currently, all directory files in the uncompressed local path will be
# compressed into the archive. When uncompressed, they will be set to the 
# specified permissions.
#
# Format: "<archive repo path/name> <uncompressed local path> <octal perms>

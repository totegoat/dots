# Toterfile 
#
# This file is imported by toter.sh (github.com/totegoat/toter) as a 
# configuration file of sorts, though it is technically BASH script.
#
# Place this file in the root of your dotfiles Git repository for the Toter
# tool to be able to know how to handle your dotfiles.
#
# Toter has essentially two overarching management actions: pull and push. 
# This is order that this configuration file is processed by toter.sh:
#
#    PULL                              PUSH
#    ------------------------          ---------------------
#    0. Packages (if enabled)          N/A
#    1. Directories (create)           Archives (zip)
#    2. Dotfiles (link)                Secrets (encrypt)
#    3. Secrets (decrypt)              Dotfiles (push)
#    4. Archives (unzip)               Directories (ignored)

# DIRECTORIES 
#
# These are required directories that must exist before dotfiles, secrets, and
# archives are placed into them.
#
# Directories will NOT be tracked by Git. 
#
# For example, if your .vimrc is configured to use .vim/tmp for your backup 
# files, you just want it created to support your .vimrc, but not tracking
# all those files in Git.
#
# If you want a directory and its contents to be tracked, put them in DOTFILES. 
#
# Format: "directory permissions"
#
dotdirs=(
    # Toter will create both .vim and tmp, but if you want a different perm
    # set for the .vim parent dir, then specify it before (".vim 740"), as 
    # elements of this array are processed in order.
    ".vim/tmp 755"

    # don't want this tracked, but need it for SSH config
    ".ssh 700"       

    # encrypted archive of server keys will unzip here
    ".ssh/keys 700"
